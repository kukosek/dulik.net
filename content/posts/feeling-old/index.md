Oh yeah I do, and I am only 15! I don't want to age just now.
*what is wrong with me*

## I am scared of getting old

My grandpa gave me lessons about how should I not hurry with life.
He told me how he and his friends always wanted to move to the next
step - get the ID, become adult, graduate, find a job, move out, build a house..

Now that he's retired, he realised how stupid that was. He says that once
he settled down, time started going way too fast.

Currently I feel like I am in the perfect age. I can enjoy my teenhood,
be somewhat free, do any funny things I want to. I want to enjoy the
teen vibes but I don't really know how, exactly.

When I get even older, I want to remember these times in a nice way. My fear is that
I would feel I didn't dig the best out of these times. Also I hope
I won't be remembering these as the best moments in my life. I hope much greater
times are yet to come up.

## Quarantine problems

Since we are mainly home for months, life became a little bit dull.

### Time flies too fast

Monotonous days. Repeated routines. I am not exactly bored these days, but yu know.

Way too fast

### What once were memories is now fog

This problem is tightly bonded with the one before. When you are just home everyday, you
don't remember a damn thing. Most of the times I am trying to remember what I
did the week before I don't remember anything. Fortunately a few things i am sure
i'll remember happened in march. so now it wasn't so bad.

## How to make life not dull

I would like to achieve some diversity in the things I do. So when I remember a certain
period in my life something nice and special comes to my mind.

How exactly achieve this state in this world? **TODO.**
